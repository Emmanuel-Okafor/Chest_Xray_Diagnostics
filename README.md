# Chest_Xray_Diagnostics

A pilot development of a chest X-ray diagnostic tool: This project entails the development  of a deep learning model 
for classifying an x-ray image containing pneumonia or not. 

The deep learning recognition model was build from DenseNet121 and the deployment was done on Gradio framework. 

We employed the ipython file (DenseNet121_model_training.ipynb) for training the DeneseNet121 model.

# Link to the model weights generated:

model weight: 'COVIDDenseNet121_10_epochs.h5' (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TzgIrrI2-5jdMYo8z_VmtN2kDb9IqDBy/view?usp=sharing)

After training for 10 epochs, the trained model is 68% accurate at testing phase and could get better when the deep learning algorithm 
is trained for long time duration.

# Data Source
We employed the training set and testing set (treated as validation set since it contains sufficient amount of data) from the data 
within the link below were used when training the deep learning recognition model.

The validation data from the above link was treated as testing set in our experiment, this is because the amount of images were small 
(16 images divided into two equal part; whereby each class contains 8 images).
