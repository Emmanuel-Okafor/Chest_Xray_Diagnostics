# Chest_Xray_Diagnostics

A pilot development of a chest X-ray diagnostic tool: This project entails the development  of a deep learning model 
for classifying an x-ray image containing pneumonia or not. 

The deep learning recognition model was build from DenseNet121 and the deployment was done on Gradio framework. 

We employed the ipython file (DenseNet121_model_training.ipynb) for training the DeneseNet121 model.

After training for 10 epochs, the trained model is 68% accurate at testing phase and could get better when the deep learning algorithm 
is trained for long time duration.
